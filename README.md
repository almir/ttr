Do Not Interrupt
===

Have you ever had a situation when your phone rang in the middle of some important meeting or during a class?<br>
Ever wanted to have a good night sleep with no disturbing calls in the middle of the night?<br>
Maybe you just donâ€™t want to be available during a specific time period for whatever reason?<br>
Then ___Do Not Interrupt___ is the right application for you.<br><br>
It behaves as an airplane or silent mode scheduler, enabling you to schedule time when you want your device to automatically enable or disable airplane or silent mode. You can choose whether you want your schedule to execute only once or on specific days of week. Once your schedule is set just enable it and let ___Do Not Interrupt___ do its thing.<br><br>
__IMPORTANT:__ This application requires __root__ permission on Android versions 4.2 and above if you want the airplane mode scheduling to be enabled (to check your version go to _Settings_, then tap _About phone_ on your device and check out the _Android version_ field). This is because the way of controlling the airplane mode feature itself has been changed since Android 4.2. If you do not have root, or do not know what root is, and you have one of the above mentioned versions of Android only scheduling silent mode will be enabled for you.
