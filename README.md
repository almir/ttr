Do Not Interrupt
===

Have you ever had a situation when your phone rang in the middle of some important meeting or during a class?<br>
Ever wanted to have a good night sleep with no disturbing calls in the middle of the night?<br>
Maybe you just donâ€™t want to be available during a specific time period for whatever reason?<br>
Then _Do Not Interrupt_ is the right application for you.<br><br>
It behaves as an airplane or silent mode scheduler, enabling you to schedule time when you want your device to automatically enable or disable airplane or silent mode. You can choose whether you want your schedule to execute only once or on specific days of week. Once your schedule is set just enable it and let _Do Not Interrupt_ do its thing.
